## Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the market. It checks if there is an open position. If there is no open position, it checks if the spread is within the acceptable range. If the spread is acceptable, it calls the `IdentifyPattern()` function to check if a recurring pattern is identified. If a pattern is identified, it opens a new position using the `OrderSend()` function.

The `IdentifyPattern()` function is responsible for analyzing historical data to identify recurring patterns in the market. The logic for pattern identification should be implemented in this function. If a pattern is identified, the function should return true; otherwise, it should return false.
